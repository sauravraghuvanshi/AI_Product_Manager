#### What AI Cannot Do (Well)

Despite its advancements, AI still struggles with tasks requiring an **understanding of context and common sense, empathy, or the application of ethical principles.** Due to its reliance on training data, AI can also fail to adapt to completely new tasks without prior examples. Tasks that involve developing empathetic relationships, **making ethical judgment calls,** or showing cultural sensitivity remain out of reach for today's AI systems. However, as technology continues to evolve, it's possible that AI will improve in these areas, slowly closing the gap between what humans and machines can do.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

**Machine learning** is a field of computer science where computers learn from data to make predictions or decisions without being programmed for each specific task.

#### Supervised Learning:

Supervised learning models learn from labelled data and map inputs to correct outputs based on provided examples. In supervised learning, **classification** predicts categories or groups for given input data. The goal is to assign inputs to specific classes based on their features, such as determining whether or not an email is spam. In contrast, **regression** focuses on predicting continuous or numeric values. It aims to model the relationship between input features and output values, such as estimating the price of a house based on its size, location, or other features.

#### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning models learn from **unlabeled data**, discovering patterns and groupings without specific guidance. A type of unsupervised learning called clustering involves grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities. Its goal is to identify natural groupings within the data, such as segmenting customers into different market segments based on purchasing behavior. Alternatively, anomaly detection focuses on identifying data points that stand out from the norm. It aims to find unusual patterns or outliers, such as identifying fraudulent transactions in financial data.

#### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning models learn by having an agent interact with an environment and receive rewards (or penalties) to develop optimal strategies (or policies) to achieve a desired outcome (or state).
For example, game-playing AI learns a model of the game's rules (how the game state changes with each move) and uses this model to guess future states and plan optimal moves, like in the AlphaGo algorithm for playing Go.

### Moodel Training

**Model training** involves teaching a machine learning model to make accurate predictions by providing it with data and allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within that data. This iterative process continues until the model reliably performs its task on new, unseen data.

A few key elements in model training are data, design, compute, and tuning. To fully understand the diversity of real-world scenarios, models must be provided with a large amount of **data** so that they can generalize. When choosing the **design** or architecture for a model, engineers must consider the specific problem and computational resources available to solve it. Finally, careful **tuning**, or adjusting model parameters, is important for improving its effectiveness in making predictions with new data. When a model's predictions cannot be generalized due to its close alignment to its original dataset, that's called overfitting.

#### Choosing Data for Training Your AI Models

Data is crucial for training AI models because it provides examples from which the model learns patterns and relationships, enabling accurate future predictions. When collecting data for your models, keep these points in mind:
- Relevance: Ensure your data is relevant to the specific problem your model aims to solve so it learns the right patterns.
- Diversity: Make sure your data covers a wide range of scenarios to help your model generalize to new situations
- Quality: High-quality data reduces errors and inconsistencies, leading to more reliable and accurate predictions.

### Traditional vs. Generative AI

**Generative AI** creates new content, like text, images, videos, and audio, by learning patterns from large datasets, often using unlabeled data. Unlike traditional AI, which analyzes input to produce predictions or classifications, generative AI uses neural networks to generate creative outputs based on prompts. A **prompt** is a text or instruction given to the AI model to guide the content it creates.

For instance, given a descriptive prompt, a generative model can create a new image in a specific art style by drawing on its training from thousands of paintings. **Foundation models** from companies like Meta, OpenAI, or Google simplify this process by providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

Generative AI can create realistic images, write human-like text for chatbots, compose music, create marketing materials, and more. This technology expands the possibilities of what AI can achieve, offering innovative solutions across industries.

### ML in Business

AI is revolutionizing industries by boosting productivity, fostering innovation, and generating new opportunities across various sectors. In **manufacturing**, AI is transforming production processes and maintenance schedules with predictive analysis that can reduce costs. **Healthcare** benefits from AI through quick diagnostics and streamlined drug delivery, enhancing patient care and treatment efficiency. Additionally, in **transportation**, AI drives efficiency in logistics and is advancing self-driving technology, revolutionizing the movement of goods and people.

#### Case Study: Blue River Technology
Blue River Technology's See & Spray product, acquired by John Deere for over $300 million, is transforming agriculture by combining robotics, machine learning, and computer vision. This technology differentiates weeds from crops in real-time and selectively sprays herbicides. It uses **image recognition** to accurately target weeds and minimize chemical usage. This helps to combat herbicide resistance caused by overuse and reduces operational costs thus promoting more sustainable farming practices.

#### Case Study: Duolingo
Duolingo leverages AI such as large language models (LLMs) to enhance its language learning platform. The Duolingo Max product uses **natural language understanding, generative AI for text creation, and machine translation** to provide features like instant feedback and detailed explanations. The "Roleplay" feature allows users to practice realistic conversations with AI, while the "Explain My Answer" feature helps users understand their mistakes. These enhancements create a more immersive and effective learning environment, increasing user engagement and improving learning outcomes.

### AI Project Lifecycle

#### Some Causes of ML Project Failure
- **`Solving the wrong problem:`** Some projects fail because they do not address a problem that is important to end-users or the business.
- **`Not having the right data:`** Projects can fail due to a lack of access to necessary data, collecting the wrong type of data, or having poor-quality data.
- **`Not having the right team.`** The AI field faces a significant talent shortage, making it challenging for companies to assemble teams with the necessary expertise for successful AI development.

To mitigate these issues, use research to ensure you're solving a significant problem, invest in strategic data collection and access to high-quality and relevant data, and take your time to assemble a team with the necessary domain expertise.


#### CRISP-DM Process

The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) is an iterative methodology for data mining and analytics projects. It provides a structured approach to planning and executing data-related tasks, including AI and ML projects.
