# AI Product Manager

As a product manager, staying ahead of the curve with AI expertise is crucial in today's competitive landscape. This repo will equip you with the skills to identify AI opportunities and deliver significant value.

## Leveraging Data and AI 

This repo is for product managers who want to build AI products. It does not require any prior familiarity with AI. You'll start by learning how AI can be applied, the different types of AI, data needs for AI, and the AI product lifecycle. Then, you'll dive deeper into two types of AI that can leverage existing datasets: personalization and forecasting. You'll learn some technical details about how these models work and how to evaluate them. Finally, you'll pull this all together into a project where you'll develop a PRD for an AI-enabled gift recommendation system in an e-commerce setting.
